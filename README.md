Django Rickshaw Graph (DRG)
===========================

A critical aspect of any cloud is the ability to visualize data about the
resources under management (servers, disks, networks). In an OpenStack cloud,
this visualization can be done via the Horizon User Interface. This
functionality can have a major impact on our customers' ability to see the
state of their cloud. This software implements some basic graphing
functionality that will be integrated into some data visualization
contributions to the OpenStack Horizon project.

The software is implemented using Rickshaw JS
(http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/) and also includes a basic Django
(https://www.djangoproject.com) backend/server for development/demonstration
purposes.
